1) create a controller called outbound_impressions
2) in that controller you need a create action
3) in the view where you display the link to the outbound resource, don't put the link url in. instead put the link route to your outbound impressions controller create action, with a method of POST and pass in the story id.
4) in the create action of the OBI controller you log the impression off the story like I showed you in the stories show controller/action.
5) then you redirect the user to the @story.url
