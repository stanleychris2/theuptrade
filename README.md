###UpTrade Rails Project

This is the source code to the site operating at
http://www.theuptrade.com.  It is a Rails 4 codebase and uses a
PostgreSQL backend for the database. This is a fork from the codebase 
located at lobste.rs with changes made to the markup and user 
authentication code. 

While you are free to fork this code and modify it (according to the [license]
to run your own link aggregation website, this source code repository and bug
tracker are only for the site operating at theuptrade.com


####Initial setup

* Install Ruby. Supported Ruby versions include 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and 2.1.0.

* Checkout the lobsters git tree from Github

         $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:cstanley2/lobsters.git
         $ cd lobsters
         lobsters$ 

* Run Bundler to install/bundle gems needed by the project:

         lobsters$ bundle

* Create a MySQL (other DBs supported by ActiveRecord may work, only MySQL and
MariaDB have been tested) database, username, and password and put them in a
`config/database.yml` file:

          development:
            adapter: mysql2
            encoding: utf8mb4
            reconnect: false
            database: lobsters_dev
            socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
            username: *username*
            password: *password*
            
          test:
            adapter: sqlite3
            database: db/test.sqlite3
            pool: 5
            timeout: 5000

* Load the schema into the new database:

          lobsters$ rake db:schema:load

* Create a `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` file, using a randomly
generated key from the output of `rake secret`:

          Lobsters::Application.config.secret_key_base = 'your random secret here'

* (Optional, only needed for the search engine) Install Sphinx.  Build Sphinx
config and start server:

          lobsters$ rake ts:rebuild

* Define your site's name and default domain, which are used in various places,
in a `config/initializers/production.rb` or similar file:

          class << Rails.application
            def domain
              "example.com"
            end
          
            def name
              "Example News"
            end
          end
          
          Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = Rails.application.domain

* Create an initial administrator user and at least one tag:

          lobsters$ rails console
          Loading development environment (Rails 3.2.6)
          irb(main):001:0> u = User.new(:username => "test", :email => "test@example.com", :password => "test", :password_confirmation => "test")
          irb(main):002:0> u.is_admin = true
          irb(main):003:0> u.is_moderator = true
          irb(main):004:0> u.save

          irb(main):005:0> t = Tag.new
          irb(main):006:0> t.tag = "test"
          irb(main):007:0> t.save

* Run the Rails server in development mode.  You should be able to login to
`http://localhost:3000` with your new `test` user:

          lobsters$ rails server
